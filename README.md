ALX Frontend ReactJS App

This is a frontend React application scaffolded using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and React. It is part of my learning journey in the ALX Software Engineering program, focused on modern web development using fast and efficient tools.

Project Setup

This project was created using:

- Vite
- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)

Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alx-fe-reactjs.git
   cd alx-fe-reactjs
=======
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
